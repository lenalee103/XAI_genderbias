I made the following changes

(1) I also dropped TIV, as it significantly differs between males and females in general (females have a 10% smaller brain compared to females)
df = df.drop(['ID', 'TIV'], axis=1) 


(2) the privileged group is males with the label 0, so 
    favorable_label=0,
    unfavorable_label=1
    
(3) I added grid searches for SVM and XGBoost

(4) Validation and Testsets are evaluated, however, everything regarding validation set is commented and not part of the ms

(5) I added the calculatoin and visualization of optimal classification threshold (in case, a reviewer would like to know;-)
(6) I added further output metrics
(7) I added XAI for osiginal and debiased models

(8) All models are included within the code: 
Adversarial Debiasing and Prejudice Remover after Scaling/SMOTE
calibrated Equal Odds Post-processing after model interpretation of the original model
Reweighing and Disparate Impact Remover after this
